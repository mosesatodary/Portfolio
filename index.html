        <h2>My Career Vision</h2>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to become an expert in C++, one of the most powerful and versatile programming languages in the tech industry.
          I'm working towards developing my own game engine, which will serve as the foundation for creating innovative games and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          By delving into low-level programming, I aim to strengthen my understanding of computer architecture and improve my ability
          to write optimized, high-performance code. I’m also driven to master assembly language, as it provides unparalleled insight into
          the relationship between software and hardware.
